# Number Plate Detection using EasyOCR and OpenCV

This Python script detects vehicle number plates from a video using OpenCV and reads the plate text using EasyOCR.

## Features
- Detects vehicle number plates using Haar cascades.
- Extracts text from detected plates using EasyOCR.
- Supports video input or webcam feed.
- Displays real-time video with detected plate bounding boxes and text.
- Prints unique detected plate numbers.

## Requirements

Install the following Python packages:
```bash
pip install easyocr opencv-python-headless numpy
```

## Usage

1. Replace `'traffic.mp4'` with the path to your own video file or use `0` to access the webcam.
2. Run the script using Python.

## Output

- Real-time window showing the detected plates.
- Console output with all unique number plates detected.

## Notes

- The Haar cascade used (`haarcascade_russian_plate_number.xml`) may need tuning for accuracy depending on region/vehicle styles.
- EasyOCR is used to read the number plate text from cropped plate regions.

## Exit

Press `q` to stop the video processing and exit.
